                Being productive as a college student can be challenging due to classes,
                assignments, work, and social life. Developing strong habits can help
                students manage their time more effectively.
            </p>

            <p>
                Productivity is not about working nonstop. It is about working smarter,
                setting priorities, and creating routines that support academic success.
